The following files were generated with `alien -k` on a Debian 3.0
genuine system (from the corresponding Red Hat packages):
cross-mint-libc_0.57.3-1_i386.deb
cross-mint-libc-debug_0.57.3-1_i386.deb
cross-mint-libc-devel_0.57.3-1_i386.deb
cross-mint-libc-profile_0.57.3-1_i386.deb
cross-mint-libc-src_0.57.3-1_i386.deb

Please note that the last package (the one containing the source) is
probalby not a real "source-package" according to Debian standards.
So better get the original source code if you care about this.
This will be fixed eventually if someone tell whatever else to do.
