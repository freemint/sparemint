Attention:
----------

From version 0.55.3 MiNTLib development use cvs as version control
system. The current development branch is available through anonymous
cvs access.

If you want to contribute code/patches to the MiNTLib it's strictly
recommended that you use cvs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains MiNTLib source archives.  Versions that end in 
a lowercase letter (e. g. 0.54.1b) are unstable alpha versions and should 
only be downloaded by the experienced or very patient user.  Archives
that end in ``.bin.tar.gz'' are precompiled binary versions.  If you have
rpm you will rather install a binary rpm instead that is available from
the Sparemint server.  Note that not all MiNTLib versions are available
as precompiled binaries.  

Please read the file README-about-patches if you update your source tree
from a patch file.  The absence of a patch file that leads from one version
to the next is usually a sign that the resulting patch would be bigger than
the new archive.

Please read README.1st before you upgrade from a version prior to 0.55.

If the above mentioned files do not appear in the directory listing
the web server has hidden them.  Use the symbolic links PATCHES.README
(-> README-about-patches) and IMPORTANT (-> README.1st) instead.
