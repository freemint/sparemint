This is README for Sparemint.

Sparemint is not a full-blown distribution as you may know it from other
operating systems.  This has mainly two reasons:

- Sparemint is not yet ready. ;-)
- It is not intended to be such a full-blown distribution.

Sparemint is based on the Redhat Package Manager rpm.  You will find a 
binary port of this program in the subdirectory `misc'.  Please
install rpm first.

Next you should prepare your system for Sparemint.  Sparemint expects 
a certain directory structure as well as the existence of certain users 
(with certain user ids) and certain groups (with certain group ids).  You
should read the file SETUP for more information on this.

If you want to join the Sparemint project you should contact the current
maintainers

	Frank Naumann <fnaumann(at)freemint.de> or
	Guido Flohr <guido(at)freemint.de>

If you plan to contribute your own ports of software you should also
check the file `FAQ.MiNT'.

If you plan to contribute a full-blown MiNT distribution to the MiNT
community you should consider to base it on Sparemint.  If you plan to
mirror this site or this directory you're welcome!
