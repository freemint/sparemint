<h2>Sparemint Artwork</h2>
<em></em>If you like the logos on the Sparemint site you
have the opportunity
to download the full-sized images from this page. Please note that
just because you don't have to throw coins into your machine's disk
slot doesn't mean that the images on this page have no copyright
(unless otherwise stated). Nobody will sue you if just use the images
but we would consider it an un-unfriendly act if you cared to notify
the copyright holders if you use their work.
<h3>Why GIF?</h3>
<p>
It is our wish to keep this site GIF-free. The Portable Networks
Graphics format PNG should be the first choice for image files on
the web whenever the lossages from JPEG files are undesirable. The
Sparemint site has all necessary tools for processing PNG files
ready for <a href="html/packages/libpng.html">download</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately the most common WEB browser available for MiNT cannot
display inlined PNG and so we have to close our eyes and use GIF
until this situation changes.
</p>
<h3>JPEG vs. PNG</h3>
<p>
JPEG has the big advantage that even large images compress very
well. But the format is lossy. If you want to further process
an image you should download the PNG version instead. </p>
<p>
You can view (and download) full-size versions of all images by
clicking on the thumbnails. Clicking the left thumbnail will
lead you to the JPEG resp. GIF version, clicking on the right thumbnail
will produce the PNG version of the image.
</p>
<h3>Complete Directory</h3>
<p>
The <a href="html/images/">images directory</a> of
the Sparemint
site provides all graphics used. You will also find some variations
of the images shown here, either in format or in size.

<h2>Sparemint Logo</h2>
<p>
This logo was created by Katherine Ellis. The connaisseur will
recognize immediately the influences of Pieter Brueghel sen. and Johann
Sebastian Bach. However the artist knew how to spice up these
historical roots with a melange of opalescent
surrealistic effects in a most provocative manner. Although this
outstanding piece of art only dates from 1999 it is already considered
to belong to modern classics in computer graphics.

<h2>Powered By FreeMiNT</h2>
<p>
An early work from the eclectic period of <a href="http://stud.uni-sb.de/%7Egufl0000">Guido Flohr</a>.
The contrast
between the most tender brush strokes that the MiNT leaves are composed
of
and the powerful stems of the letters lend and unnatural strength and
force
to this <em>chef d'&#339;vre</em>. The simple yet most
convincing text <em>"Powered By ...</em> has become
proverbial and has led to
a true inflation of Powered-By-Logos that can be found all over the
internet today.

<h2>Photo Gallery</h2>
<p>
A lot of people have asked us for photographs of the two founders
of the Sparemint project Frank Naumann and Guido Flohr. But, alas,
celebrity makes shy and although there are certainly people on
the black market that would give a <a href="html/packages/fortune-mod.html">fortune</a> if
only they could
get hold of a photo of their idols it is deemed impossible among
photo journalists all over the planet to get these two brave guys
in front of their lens.
Surprising enough that only recently a veritable army of the world's
leading
paparazzi has managed to take this exciting snapshot of the two lads
after chasing them from their appartment on 5<sup>th</sup>
avenue all
the way down to Broadway where they thought they could spend some
of the zillions of their Sparemint royalties in disguise. Lean back
and enjoy!
