their work to it.  Software maintainers are listed in the file AUTHORS
in the same directory.  Apart from that our thanks go to:

  support into the Redhat Package Manager and has helped with a lot
  of problems in the very beginning.

  who contributed the Sparemint logo and was kind enough to do that
  work twice because of a misunderstanding.
