FreeMiNT 1.15.10, beta release
==============================

Please read this whole README from top to bottom. Doing so helps to
avoid confusion.

This is a beta version with important bugfixes compared to the official
FreeMiNT 1.15.9 beta release. Please refer to the ChangeLog for a detailed
list of all changes.


Attention
=========

From the last beta release until now many things have happened. We now
use the CVS version control system for source integrity and source
management. That's why several things are now handled in a new way.

First of all, most of the kernel modules are now part of the CVS
tree and no longer maintained seperately. There will be no seperate
releases of those modules in the future.

The same also applies to FreeMiNT related tools that are part of the CVS
tree.


kernel:
=======

Here is a short summary of the most important kernel changes:

- new boot menu that comes up if you hold the SHIFT key during loading
  of the kernel
- slightly optimized memory management
- integrated ramdisk with much more accurate Dfree()
- new high precision delay routines (added to kerinfo too)
- totally new module loading routines
- profiling support for the kernel itself
- fix of the (f->links <= 0) problem
- many other bugfixes
- due to CVS, total redesign of the source tree
  completely new Makefile framework
  removed much redundant code from module
